# LifeTime

This repository contains a simple HTML front-end code which allows to generate a simple widget,
which can then be embedded into an application like Notion.

Just host it on your server, and have fun!

`index.html` contains the rendering code and required query parameters.

`input.html` can be used to generate those query parameters.
